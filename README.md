[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KowalczykBartek/micro-archetype.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KowalczykBartek/micro-archetype)

## What does it do?

#### 1) Simple and fast
Just fork it/download and run ! It is main goal of this project, SIMPLIFICATION !

#### 2) Basic conventions
Sample use cases for calling external services established, sample acceptance and unit tests written, if you do not
have idea how to do it on your own, just copy existing examples.

#### 3) Defended and documented
Hystrix gives us security - use cases for things like circuit breaker or collapsing are documented(using tests !)

#### 4) Configured
Basic stuff needed to communicate with other services is prepared, just send JSON and receive JSON, no worries about
dependencies in maven or mapper for javax.
